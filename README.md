# Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks-1-Day-Workshop
In the Deep Learning &amp; Neural Networks 1 Day Workshop, we discussed about the concepts of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning &amp; Deep Learning. We covered the theories and mathematics behind Deep Feed Forward type Neural Networks and at the last phase of the workshop a Neural Network was implemented in Google Co-Lab using Tensorflow and Keras.
